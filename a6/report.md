How much space does your Trie and Array implementation take (using asymptotic analysis, and calculate in bytes 
for this particular set of words)?


How much time (in terms of cycles-- see note below) does it take to look up
 the following words in both the Trie and Array?
zoloft
apple
butterfly
kite
saturday
umbrella
slzieoqm


How long (number of cycles and clock time) did it take to create each data structure?


Overall, which is the better data structure for this use case?


Is there a use case where you believe the other data structure would be better? Describe it.
