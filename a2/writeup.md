#CS5004 Assignment 2 Write Up - Dan Williams 5/21/19

* For the small, medium, and large arrays, I sorted 4, 128, and 1,024 items respectively.

* For the smallest, a number that was a low multiple of 2 that could pass through 
  sorting algorithm 1 time made sense to me.

* For the largest, a number that was a larger multiple of 2 that would run in a lengthy,
   yet reasonable amount of time made sense to choose.

* While bubblesort has a time complexity of O(n^2), this algorithm has the capability of
  being more relatively effective for any given list size due to its logarithmic 
  characteristic. It has a lower bound of N log(N) and an upper bound of N^2.

* The most difficult part of this assignment is having to learn the fundamentals and syntax
  of C while implementing an algorithm that behaves differently than any we have seen
  previously.
