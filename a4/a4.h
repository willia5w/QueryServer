/*
 * NOTES:
Here is a summary of how the three structures are
intended to work in regards to memory:
For each round of the game, you create 2 new Hands,
deal Cards from the Deck to the Hands. As Players play
Cards, the cards go back to the Deck (removed from the
Hand; the CardNode is freed). At the end of the round,
the Hands go away (are freed), but the Cards are now
in the Deck and can be re-used for the next round.
The function returnHandToDeck() is a helper that
takes all the Cards out of the Hand and returns them to
the Deck.
At the end of the game, destroy the Deck by removing all
the Cards from the Deck, free them, and free the Deck.
